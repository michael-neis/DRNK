# DRNK

DRNK is a frontend search application for finding the perfect cocktail. It was built using JavaScript and custom CSS.

DRNK is the final project of our phase 1 JavaScript module at Flatiron School.

## Launch

To run DRNK locally, all you need to do is clone it down.

DRNK is set up to fetch data directrly from <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/">TheCocktatilDB</a>, so there is no need to set up any local ports.

Simply run the `index.html` file in your browser, and you're good to go.

## Walkthrough

In order to use DRNK, simply add ingredients you would like to filter by in the "Search Ingredients" bar. As you add ingredients, you will see that the list of cocktails supplied will be filtered to match all cocktails that incude your ingredients.

By clicking on a cocktail name, you can see it's full list of ingredients, as well as a list of instructions to make it and an accompanying image.

If you would like to clear the ingredients you have entered and start over, simply click the "Reset" button.

You can also receive a random list of 10 cocktails by clicking the button marked with a "?".

Enjoy, and please drink responsibly!
